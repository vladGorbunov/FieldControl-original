*FieldControl v1.0 for Lotus Notes R5/R6 release was on 20 August 2004.
FieldControl is useful auxiliary tool for every Notes programmer, admin and advanced user.*

*FieldControl for Lotus Notes is like "extended properties box" for Notes documents that allow viewing, modifying, deleting and creating fields (items) in the document. It can store or print sorted list of all items of document and can produce LotusScript to recreate entire document. FieldControl provides for batch processing documents and can access "design" documents.*
  
  Initial code was written somehere in 1998-1999 for R4, so it is looks ugly now.
